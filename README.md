# Project Overview

Game Name：  
birdPlumber（小鸟管道工）

Game Introduction：
In a picturesque town, there lived a group of hardworking birds. These birds were not only skilled at flying but also mastered a special craft—pipe repair. Among them, there was a bird named Pip, who was the best plumber in town. Pip was not only an excellent flyer but also a kind-hearted bird who was always willing to help others.  
One day, the town’s main water pipe system suffered a severe malfunction. The pipes were filled with obstructions, blocking the water flow, and the residents couldn't get enough clean water. Faced with this urgent situation, Pip decided to take on the task. Pip needed to fly through a series of obstacle-filled pipes, skillfully balancing up and down to ensure smooth passage through each pipe opening and fixing the problems within the pipes.  
During this journey, Pip would encounter various challenges, including narrow pipe openings, sudden obstacles, and occasional wind changes. Your task is to help Pip control the flying height by pressing the spacebar to keep Pip balanced and successfully navigate through each pipe opening. With each pipe cleared, Pip gets closer to the goal, ultimately repairing the entire water pipe system and restoring the normal water supply for the town’s residents.  
  
  （在一个风景如画的小镇上，住着一群勤劳的小鸟。这些小鸟不仅擅长飞行，还掌握了一门特殊的技艺——修理管道。有一只小鸟名叫皮皮，它是小镇上最优秀的管道工。皮皮不仅飞行技术高超，还是一个心地善良的小鸟，总是乐于帮助他人。有一天，小镇的主要水管系统出现了严重的故障，水管里充满了障碍物，水流被阻断，居民们无法获得足够的清水。面对这紧急情况，皮皮决定承担起这次任务。它需要飞过一系列布满障碍的管道，通过巧妙地上下平衡，确保能够顺利穿过每一个管道口，修复管道中的问题。在这过程中，皮皮会遇到各种挑战，包括狭窄的管道口、突然出现的障碍物和不时出现的风力变化。你的任务是帮助皮皮控制飞行高度，通过按空格键来使它保持平衡，顺利穿越一个又一个管道口。每当穿过一个管道口，皮皮就会离目标更近一步，最终修复整个水管系统，为小镇居民恢复正常的供水。）
